        <p class="info">Hello there, welcome to my portfolio page. My story is rather simple. Have you ever
        had that feeling with a job that makes you feel a little empty inside? Like there is something missing?
        I had that feeling, in fact I had that feeling for quite some time. However, along
        came computer programming and that forever has changed my life. Nothing has quite
        changed me so much (outside of my beautiful wife) than computer programming. I
        have spent countless hours reading documentation, coding along with classes;
        once you experience seeing something that you have created, there is
        nothing quite like it. This has grown into my passion, and while there are challenges,
        the gratification that goes along with coding is truly something special. So with that,
        thanks for stopping by and hopefully I might become the developer you're looking for.
