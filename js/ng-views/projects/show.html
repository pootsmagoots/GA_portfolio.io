     This full stack app was made in a group setting. I was responsible for the backend
     portion of the application. The frontend of the app was made with Angular, while
     the backend was Ruby on Rails. This was the first time working with other developers
     the collaboration aspect of this project was what I enjoyed the most.

     Scheduler_App was my first project involving Ruby on Rails.This app has user authentication,
     along with the UI and backend built with Rails. This app helps keeps track of upcoming
     meetings and events.

  <p>
  This was my very first project. This project uses Javascript, JQuery, HTML
  and CSS. Having a deadline along with using a lot of these technologies for
  the first time. Helped me utilize effective time management and getting a better
  grasp at these languages. Definitely a begginers project but I'm proud that is has functionality.
