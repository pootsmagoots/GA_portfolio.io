     This full stack app was made in a group setting. I was responsible for the backend
     portion of the application. The frontend of the app was made with Angular, while
     the backend was Ruby on Rails. This was the first time working with other developers
     the collaboration aspect of this project was what I enjoyed the most.

     Scheduler_App was my first project involving Ruby on Rails. This app has user authentication,
     along with the UI and backend built with Rails. This app helps keeps track of upcoming
     meetings and events.

  This was my first real free lance job outside of GA. It has a lot of influence from my previous
  work, but also tried some new ideas. This website was built with Angular and SASS.
  The real challenge was working with a real client and trying to get everything they want incorporated
  into their website. People take these sites very seriously (as they should) and this was a good learning
  experience for things yet to come.
